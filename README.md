This project is about a data structure calling Graph and specifically an undirectional weighted graph.

The project contains 3 classes :
1. Node_Info inner class which implements the node_info interface
2. WGraph_DS which implements the weighted_graph interface
3. WGraph_Algo which implements the weighted_graph_algorithms interface

## The Classes

### Node_Info
This class contains basic parameters and method on a node.
Each node as a unique key , a meta data ,tag and a collection of his neighbors- using HashMap

### WGraph_DS
The class use a hashMap to keep his nodes. The methods are classic and appropriate to
an undirectional weighted graph.

### WGraph_Algo
 This class implements  the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms including the short path between 2 nodes,
 the distance between them and if the graph is connected. These three methods use the BFS algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm.
